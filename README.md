# Sports Equipment E-Store – Requirements Project

## Project Context

The growing demand for fast and accessible online services, combined with the continuous evolution of digital technologies, has strongly contributed to the expansion of e-stores over recent years. This rapid growth has intensified competition, both in terms of technological innovation and commercial offerings.

Despite this evolution, many existing e-commerce platforms still present significant shortcomings, particularly regarding system reliability, usability, ergonomics, and overall user experience.

This project is part of this context. Its objective is to define, analyze, and structure the requirements of an online e-store dedicated to the sale of sports equipment, with a specific focus on technical, functional, and organizational aspects necessary for the design of an efficient, secure, and reliable system.

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

To identify and formalize the requirements of a sports equipment e-store

To structure these requirements following a requirements engineering approach

To distinguish clearly between:

the Environment Book (context and constraints)

the System Book (system behavior and structure)

To automate the generation of a final requirements document in PDF and HTML formats

## Repository Organization & Workflow

To ensure a clean and collaborative development process, we adopted a branch-based workflow:

main
The main branch containing stable and validated versions of the project.

feat2/branche-requirement
Dedicated to the writing and refinement of the requirements documents (Environment Book and System Book).

Documentation branch
Used for updates and improvements to the README.md file and project documentation.

This workflow allows:

clear separation of responsibilities

better version control

easier review and validation of changes

## Technologies & Tools

### Documentation & Requirements

Markdown (.md)
Used as the intermediate format to write and maintain requirements in a readable and versionable way.

PDF & HTML
Final output formats generated automatically for submission and review.

## Automation

GitHub Actions (ci.yml)
Used to automate:

the generation of the PDF from the Markdown file

the production of consistent deliverables

the attachment of generated files to GitHub releases

## Conversion Tools

Pandoc
Used to convert Markdown documents into PDF and HTML formats.

## AI Assistance

To support the quality and consistency of the work, we used Large Language Models (LLMs):

ChatGPT

Gemini

These tools were used exclusively for:

requirement clarification

consistency checking

assistance in script writing

methodological guidance

All final decisions, validations, and content structuring remain under human control.

## Deliverables

The project provides the following deliverables:

A structured requirements document (Environment Book & System Book)

A PDF version generated automatically via CI

An HTML version for online consultation

A reproducible and documented automation pipeline

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, the repository will provide:

a clear and complete specification of the e-store requirements

a professional documentation workflow

an automated and reproducible generation process

a deliverable easily accessible by instructors via GitHub Releases
